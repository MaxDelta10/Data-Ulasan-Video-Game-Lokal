desperately want like game original dreadout perfect charming lot go keeper dark even well blunt dreadout terrible game woefully unfinished buggy lackluster game need several month development even consider acceptable product even new mechanic add seal fate stinker new melee combat clunky unresponsive would better use phone battle system entire game instead less half combat phone know decide change new openworld area empty real content find meander aimlessly road road nothing handful sidequests want gameplay miserable english translation beyond lazy nearly every sentence grammatically incorrect english voice act good game certain line dialogue like voice actor finish line developer decide release game anyway time game difficulty spike absurd degree due actual challenge instead combat awful final bos fight particular soul crush even several patch remove bug game still riddle several time reload checkpoint progress due game break glitch crash well recommend game fun real shame know good game bury deep beneath mess digital happiness well;Not Recommended
game look nice spooky unfortunately buggy two example part use phone app go hospital bug let try retry checkpoint restart work find bug convinced hour circle city beating tiger bos gate open retry last checkpoint fix though apologize negative criticism fan lot mechanic implement game major ghost sight would appear would take photo disappear fight ghost camera go get hit time bright side die except tiger bos fight unpleasant reach act many enemy block path enter door able get monster collision huge also boss attack fast phase wall magically teleports behind attack barely hit sure bug part game time hit hit time die game cool theme really try like personally find enjoyable;Not Recommended
opinon game pro graphic nice enough decent character model con riddle bug clear game direction aka map system game want one place make linear instead actually make map system matter event explore see sidequests optional ghost fight side stuff felt little justify map travel system awful story begin game interesting later certain boss make feel like game lack dodge button since felt like trading blow time final bossfight also joke spamming quick thought game felt rushed interesting idea go poorly execute like map system go linear fashion anyway start game promise part get bad;Not Recommended
personally loved game definitely see lot bug mention negative review perhaps lucky since encounter minor bug like npc miss hair bother nothing game break freeroaming nice add touch really liked able fast travel place walk around speak people new combat system really fun sometimes little frustrating slow linda swing axe bad love stab mechanic add well hopefully dreadout finally let linda able dodge story interest atmosphere nice enjoy place could visit graphic definitely upgrade checkpoint well do imo well love dreadout really liked keeper dark super happy much effort put improve game ton fun play really enjoy get achievement also chapter select incase miss anything definitely recommend play fan previous dreadout game like wait dreadout;Recommended
